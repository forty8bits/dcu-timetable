# DCU Timetable

A simple Android application for students of Dublin City University (DCU) to
quickly retrieve their online timetables on the move, without the hassle of
having to go through the various cumbersome methods of finding it (either
through the DCU website or Moodle).

Although right now this app is fairly basic, and only allows you to look at the
online version through your phones built-in browser, future improvements will
include:

+ Parsing and storage of the timetable locally on your phone, to save you both
  network usage and battery drain.
+ Lots of UI improvements, made possible by the above when implemented (it's in
  the works).

Any suggestions for features are welcome!
