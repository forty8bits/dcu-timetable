				<p>Actively developed by a group of <abbr title="Computer Applications">CA</abbr>
					 students, <strong>DCU Timetable</strong> is an Android&trade; app for finding
					 your online class timetable when you need it, all from your mobile phone.</p>

				<h2>Get the App</h2>

				<p>Although the app is still in the <em>very</em> early stages of development, it's functional right now at
					 a basic level. You can download it straight to your phone and retrieve your timetable quickly and easily
					 over the web, once you have some form of network connection.</p>

				<p>Because it's going through so many rapid changes right now, we're holding off putting it onto the Android
					 Market until it becomes a bit more feature-rich and stable. In the meantime, the latest APK for you to
					 install manually will always be avaliable <a href="http://goo.gl/YVh7q">here</a> (or scan the QR code to
					 your left).</p>

				<h2>Help Develop It!</h2>

				<p>We're developing <strong>DCU Timetable</strong> as an open source project on
					 <a href="https://github.com/garmur/dcu-timetable">GitHub&trade;</a>, so anyone is more than welcome to
					 come check out the code, fork it and mess with it in the hopes of something useful eventually happening.
					 In fact, that's encouraged.</p>

				<p>Even if you can't help with the code, but have noticed something not acting exactly how it should, or how
					 you think it should, you can help us by filing a bug report. Have an idea for a new feature? Email it to
					 us! Any input will be useful, no matter what it is.</p>
